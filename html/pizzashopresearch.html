    This is my research between the association of food with place. While originally it makes sense the place you lived established the food you ate, because I know in the South Pole they weren’t eating tropical mangoes off the tree. Therefore place established common food for countries and regions - however now, I think it’s nice the peppering of pizza shops throughout the world.</p>
