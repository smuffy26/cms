 <p><bold>This site</bold> is based on a publication — a documentation of my grandmothers and great grandmothers recipes — a publication which aims to ensure that family recipes will be passed down through the generations and not lost. </p>
<br/>
  <p> <bold>This site</bold> contains a collection of content found through google searches in order to mimick the trail that is left behind when something is lost.</p>
 <br/>
 <p> <bold>This site</bold> requires viewers to scroll down and across the page in order to find the images. The viewer may find they are staring at a blank patch of the site only to scroll and uncover more overlapping images.</p>
  
<br/>
 <p><bold>This site</bold> is created to ensure that lost objects/people/places/religions/countries that were once special to someone, that once held significant meaning or stories are not forgotten.</p>
