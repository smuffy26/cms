 <p>This site is based on a publication — a documentation of my grandmothers and great grandmothers recipes — a publication which aims to ensure that family recipes will be passed down through the generations and not lost.
<br/>
   <p> This site contains images found through google searches to mimick the trail that is left behind when something is lost.
     <br/>
 <p>This site is created to ensure that lost objects/people/places/religions/countries that were once special to someone, that once held significant meaning or stories are not forgotten.
