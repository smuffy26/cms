  ‘More Cheese Please’ is a digital publication which comments on the cliched nature of tourist photos in a playful manner. 

First and foremost, all images that appear on the site, are sourced from Instagram, one of the largest online platforms for sharing photos. The photos are not selected at random, they all fall under the hashtag #touristphoto, meaning the accounts responsible for the photos are aware that their posts are typical of tourists. These images, once collected, are then categorised into groups, according to the action performed to famous landmarks, by tourists. For example, photos of people who are trying desperately to straighten the iconic Leaning Tower of Pisa, appear pink, identifying them as members of the ‘lean on me’ category. Meanwhile, photos depicting hungry tourists, nibbling on famous structures, appear green and therefore fall under the ‘eat me’ category. In categorising the photos according to actions performed by the tourists, and highlighting similarities between images, their cliched nature becomes apparent to the audience.

The name ‘More Cheese Please’ also comments on this whole notion of cliches. The word ‘cheese’ specifically refers to the ‘cheesy’ nature of the images and draws parallels to the phrase ‘say cheese’, which of course encourages people to smile and pose whilst having their photo taken. This idea of posing is also relative to the discussion. These photos are clearly staged, great care has been taken by both the photographers and subjects to ensure the perfect alignment of elements. Does this therefore mean that the photos are inauthentic, in the same way highly edited photos of fashion models are untrue representations of the human form? 

‘More Cheese Please’, aka. some food for thought.
